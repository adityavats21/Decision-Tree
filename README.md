Decision Tree Classifier

A small hands-on project to understand how Decision Tree Classifiers work in Machine Learning.
The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic visualization using Python and scikit-learn.

 Objective

The main goal of this project is to learn how a Decision Tree can be used to classify data and to check its accuracy using different evaluation metrics.

 Steps Followed

Imported all required Python libraries

Loaded and explored the dataset

Cleaned and prepared the data for training

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using sklearn

Evaluated the model performance

Visualized the results and tree structure

 What I Learned

How Decision Trees split data based on information gain and Gini index

How to control overfitting using parameters like max_depth and criterion

How to interpret feature importance

Visualizing a trained Decision Tree using matplotlib and sklearn’s plot functions

 Libraries Used

1.pandas

2.numpy

3.matplotlib

4.seaborn

5.scikit-learn

 Summary

Decision Trees are easy to understand and explain.
They work well on both numerical and categorical data, but they can overfit small datasets — so tuning or using ensemble models like Random Forests can improve results.
